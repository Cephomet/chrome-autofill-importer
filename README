# Requirements
Windows 11 / Windows 10 / Node.js (21.6.1)
Option 1: Install Node.js Use "install-node.bat" in the folder to install using wget.
Option 2: You may install node manually from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current choose "current"
Option 3: If you have node already, you can likely skip this.

## Design
- This bat script is meant to automate functions, therefor no prerequisites need to be installed first. 
- To keep it simple, it will import sqlite3 (database functions) and update all your NPM modules to lessen issues. Comment this behavior out in the BAT file if you want to handle this manually.

## Usage 
Follow the step-by-step guide here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpDU80Dg-DtKbQ2MMieNSwUOeAHDLdpcXqrpb2AP3iM/edit?usp=sharing
- Essentially exact the folder to your desktop.
- Locate your Web Data file, from your correct Chrome User Profile (in %localappdata% ) 
- Cut/drag the file from your Chrome User Profile folder, to the folder with the script.
- Have Node.JS installed (or use install-nod.bat)
- Run the "run-script.bat"
- Cut/move the "Web Data" folder back into your Chrome User Profile.
- Start Chrome

## Potential Issues
- If you have issues opening/moving Web Data file.
- If your Data.json file has formatting issues, the script may not function right. Check your data.json file by pasting into a JSON validator like: https://jsonlint.com/
